# 🧮 Java Swing Calculator

This is a **Java-based Calculator application** built using **Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI).  
The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as **addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)** along with handling **decimal numbers** and **operator precedence**.  

The application uses a **custom expression evaluation method powered by stacks**, ensuring that multi-operator expressions (e.g., `5+2-4*3/2`) are computed correctly according to mathematical precedence rules.
